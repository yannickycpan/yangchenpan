I am a Lecturer at the [Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/yangchen-pan/). I am interested in achieving sample-efficient generalization while maintaining scalable computation. I have a particular interest in learning settings that involve distribution shift, including robustness learning, reinforcement learning, and continual learning.
