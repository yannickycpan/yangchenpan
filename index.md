<img align="left" width="120" height="130" style="margin-right: 0.8em" src="images/Yangchen-website.png">

I am a Departmental Lecturer at the [Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/yangchen-pan/). I am also a member of [Torr Vision Group](https://torrvision.com/). I am interested in achieving sample-efficient generalization while maintaining scalable computation. I have a particular interest in learning settings that involve distribution shift, including robustness learning, reinforcement learning, and continual learning.

#### To prospective students/collaborators. 

There's no need to feel unhappy or offended if there's no reply:  
1. It is unclear whether you can work well with the person you are emailing or not. Not receiving a response might have saved you from several years of negative experiences.  
2. You already consider yourself excellent before sending out the email. Hence, your excellence cannot be diminished by the person you are emailing. In other words, you will continue to excel regardless, and no one can change that.
